# Case Study & Technical Analysis: CAC Standard Cost Update Submissions

## Executive Summary

*   **Impact Analysis**: "We took a $1M hit to inventory value last month. Which update caused it?"

This report queries the cost update history.
*   **Header Info**: Update Date, Description, User.
*   **Scope**: Shows which Item Range, Category, or Cost Type was used.
