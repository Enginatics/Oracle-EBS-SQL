# INV Physical Inventory Adjustments - Case Study & Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary
The **INV Physical Inventory Adjustments** report is the financial audit trail for the physical inventory process. Once the counting is done and the variances are approved, this report details the actual adjustments made to the inventory balances. It serves as the primary document for the finance team to reconcile the Inventory GL account.

## Business Challenge
When a physical inventory is finalized, the system automatically posts adjustments to correct the on-hand balances. Finance needs to know:
-   **Total Value:** "What is the net value of the inventory write-off?"
-   **Approvals:** "Were these large adjustments approved by the correct manager?"
-   **GL Impact:** "Which GL accounts were hit by these adjustments?"

## Solution
The **INV Physical Inventory Adjustments** report lists every adjustment transaction generated by the physical inventory. It groups them by adjustment account to facilitate GL reconciliation.

**Key Features:**
-   **Detailed Listing:** Shows Item, Subinventory, Locator, Lot, Serial, and Quantity Adjusted.
-   **Financial Values:** Displays the Unit Cost and Total Value of the adjustment.
-   **Approver Tracking:** (If configured) Shows who approved the adjustment.

## Technical Architecture
The report queries the adjustment history tables. These records are created when the "Post Physical Inventory Adjustments" program is run.

### Key Tables and Views
-   **`MTL_PHYSICAL_ADJUSTMENTS`**: The core table storing the adjustment transactions.
-   **`MTL_PHYSICAL_INVENTORIES`**: The parent physical inventory record.
-   **`MTL_SYSTEM_ITEMS_VL`**: Item details.

### Core Logic
1.  **Selection:** Retrieves records from `MTL_PHYSICAL_ADJUSTMENTS` for the given Physical Inventory name.
2.  **Sorting:** Can be sorted by value to highlight the most significant adjustments first.
3.  **Filtering:** Options to include or exclude rejected adjustments.

## Business Impact
-   **Financial Reconciliation:** The "Source of Truth" for explaining the "Physical Inventory Adjustment" line on the P&L.
-   **Loss Prevention:** Helps identify high-value losses that may indicate theft or process failure.
-   **Audit Trail:** Provides a permanent record of why inventory balances were changed.
