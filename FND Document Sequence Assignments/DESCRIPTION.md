# Executive Summary
The **FND Document Sequence Assignments** report is a critical audit tool for verifying voucher numbering configurations. It shows which sequence is active for a given document category and ledger.

# Business Challenge
*   **Gap Analysis:** Ensuring that every transaction type has an active sequence assigned to prevent "Sequence not found" errors.
*   **Audit Trail:** Verifying that the correct sequence is being used for the current fiscal year.
*   **Legal Compliance:** Proving to auditors that document numbering is continuous and gapless (if required).

# The Solution
This Blitz Report joins the assignment definition with the sequence status:
*   **Assignment:** Shows the Category, Ledger (or Set of Books), and Method (Automatic, Manual, Gapless).
*   **Sequence Details:** Displays the name of the assigned sequence and its current value in the database.
*   **Date Range:** Shows the effective start and end dates of the assignment.

# Technical Architecture
The report joins `FND_DOC_SEQUENCE_ASSIGNMENTS` with `FND_DOCUMENT_SEQUENCES` and `GL_LEDGERS`. It also checks `DBA_SEQUENCES` to show the actual "Last Number" generated by the database object.

# Parameters & Filtering
*   **Application:** Filter by module.
*   **Ledger:** Filter by specific legal entity or ledger.

# Performance & Optimization
*   **Database Check:** The report queries `DBA_SEQUENCES` to get real-time values, which is very fast.

# FAQ
*   **Q: Why is the "Last Number" different from the maximum number in the table?**
    *   A: `DBA_SEQUENCES` shows the *next* available number or the cached high water mark. It may be slightly ahead of the actual used numbers due to caching.
