# [DSO - Days of Sales Metric Receivables](https://www.enginatics.com/reports/dso-days-of-sales-metric-receivables)
## Description: 
**The DSO financial indicator shows both the age in days of an organization's accounts receivables,and the average time it takes to turn those  receivables into cash.
 
The balance is expressed in terms of recent sales, and it is compared to industry and organization averages and standard selling terms.
Several methods exist for calculating DSO. It reflects the organization's internal collection efficiencies, and it requires three pieces of information for calculation:

  Total receivables for the period analyzed.
  Total credit sales for the period analyzed.
  The number of days in the period analyzed.
  
Here is the formula for the standard (regular) DSO calculation:
(Total Receivables / Total Credit Sales) ? Number of Days = Regular DSO

Here is an example scenario:

Total Receivables = 4,600,000 USD.

Total Credit Sales = 9,000,000 USD.

Number of days in period = 90.

Here is the calculation:
(4,600,000 / 9,000,000) ? 90 = 45 days
In this example, it takes 45 days (on the average) to collect the receivables. **/
