# Case Study & Technical Analysis: CAC WIP Account Detail

## Executive Summary
The **CAC WIP Account Detail** report is the forensic tool for Work in Process (WIP) accounting. It provides a line-by-line listing of every accounting entry generated by WIP transactions. This level of detail is required to diagnose complex variance issues or reconcile specific job costs.

## Business Challenge
*   **Variance Investigation**: "Job X has a $5,000 material usage variance. Which specific component caused it?"
*   **SLA Auditing**: "Did the Subledger Accounting rules correctly re-direct the labor absorption to the new cost center?"
*   **Project Manufacturing**: Tracing costs for a specific Project/Task through the manufacturing process.

## Solution
This report exposes the subledger.
*   **Granularity**: One row per accounting line (Debit/Credit).
*   **Context**: Includes Job Name, Transaction Type (e.g., "WIP Component Issue"), Resource Code, and Overhead Code.
*   **SLA Support**: Can toggle between the raw WIP transaction accounts and the final SLA-generated accounts.

## Technical Architecture
*   **Tables**: `wip_transaction_accounts` (Pre-SLA), `xla_ae_lines` (Post-SLA), `wip_entities`.
*   **Logic**: Joins the accounting lines back to the operational tables (`bom_resources`, `mtl_system_items`) for readable descriptions.

## Parameters
*   **Show SLA Accounting**: (Mandatory) "Yes" for GL matching.
*   **Transaction Date From/To**: (Mandatory) Period to analyze.
*   **WIP Job**: (Optional) Filter for a specific problem job.

## Performance
*   **Heavy**: WIP generates high transaction volumes. Always filter by Date and preferably Organization.

## FAQ
**Q: Does this show "WIP Value"?**
A: No, this shows the *Activity* (Flow) during the period. For the *Balance* (Stock), use the "WIP Account Value" report.
