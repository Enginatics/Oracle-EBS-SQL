# INV Cycle Count Listing - Case Study

## Executive Summary
The **INV Cycle Count Listing** report is a fundamental tool for Inventory Management and Warehouse Operations. It generates the official list of items scheduled for cycle counting, serving as the primary document for warehouse staff to perform physical counts. By providing a structured and accurate counting schedule, this report ensures inventory accuracy, supports compliance with audit requirements, and minimizes operational disruptions caused by stock discrepancies.

## Business Challenge
Maintaining accurate inventory levels is a constant battle for supply chain organizations:
*   **Stock Discrepancies:** "System" quantity vs. "Physical" quantity mismatches lead to missed sales or excess carrying costs.
*   **Audit Compliance:** External auditors require a systematic and documented process for verifying inventory assets.
*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Without a targeted list, warehouse staff might count random items or miss high-value items that require frequent verification (ABC analysis).
*   **Blind Counting:** Providing the system quantity to counters can lead to bias; a proper listing often needs to support "blind" counting.

## The Solution
The **INV Cycle Count Listing** provides the "Operational View" necessary to execute the cycle count process effectively.

**Key Features:**
*   **Scheduled Generation:** Based on the cycle count scheduler, ensuring that items are counted at their required frequency (e.g., A-items monthly, C-items yearly).
*   **Location Precision:** Lists items by Subinventory and Locator, guiding warehouse staff through an efficient counting path.
*   **Serial & Lot Detail:** Includes support for serial-controlled and lot-controlled items, ensuring granular accuracy.
*   **Flexibility:** Can be generated for specific subinventories or date ranges to match workforce availability.

## Technical Architecture
The report extracts data from the Inventory Cycle Counting module, linking schedule requests to item definitions.

**Primary Tables:**
*   `MTL_CYCLE_COUNT_HEADERS`: Defines the cycle count name, frequency, and parameters.
*   `MTL_CYCLE_COUNT_ENTRIES`: The core table containing the specific count requests generated by the scheduler. It links the item to the count header.
*   `MTL_SYSTEM_ITEMS_VL`: Provides item descriptions and attributes.
*   `MTL_ITEM_LOCATIONS_KFV`: Resolves locator IDs into human-readable locator codes (e.g., Row-Rack-Bin).
*   `MTL_CC_SERIAL_NUMBERS`: Handles specific serial number details for serialized counts.

**Logical Relationships:**
The report joins **Cycle Count Entries** to **System Items** and **Item Locations** to provide a readable list. It filters based on the **Cycle Count Header** to ensure only the relevant count batch is displayed.

## Parameters & Filtering
Users can refine the output to suit specific operational needs:
*   **Organization Code:** The specific warehouse or inventory organization being counted.
*   **Cycle Count Name:** The specific cycle count definition (e.g., "Main Warehouse Daily").
*   **Start/End Date:** Defines the window of scheduled counts to include.
*   **Subinventory:** Allows generating lists for specific zones or areas within the warehouse.
*   **Include Recounts Only:** Filters the list to show only items that failed tolerance checks and require a second count.

## Performance & Optimization
*   **Indexed Retrieval:** The query leverages indexes on `CYCLE_COUNT_HEADER_ID` and `ORGANIZATION_ID` to quickly retrieve pending entries.
*   **Efficient Joins:** Joins to `MTL_SYSTEM_ITEMS` and `MTL_ITEM_LOCATIONS` are optimized to handle high volumes of SKU data without performance degradation.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Does this report show the system on-hand quantity?**
A: This depends on the report configuration and the specific template used. For "blind" counts, the system quantity is typically suppressed to ensure an unbiased physical count.

**Q: Can this report handle serial number counting?**
A: Yes, the underlying architecture (`MTL_CC_SERIAL_NUMBERS`) supports listing individual serial numbers for verification.

**Q: Why are some items missing from the list?**
A: Items only appear if they have been successfully scheduled by the "Generate Cycle Count Requests" program. If an item is not due for counting based on its frequency or if it has zero on-hand (depending on setup), it may not appear.
