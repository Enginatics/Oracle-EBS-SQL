# Oracle E-Business Suite - Reporting Library 
    
We provide an open source EBS operational and project implementation support [library](https://www.enginatics.com/library/) for rapid Excel report generation. 

[Blitz Report™](https://www.enginatics.com/blitz-report/) is based on Oracle EBS forms technology, and hence requires minimal training. There are no data or performance limitations since the output files are not generated through the XML mechanism. 

Standard Oracle [BI Publisher](https://www.enginatics.com/user-guide/#BI_Publisher) and [Discoverer](https://www.enginatics.com/blog/importing-discoverer-worksheets-into-blitz-report/) reports can also be imported into Blitz Report for immediate translation to Excel. Typically, reports can be created and version tracked within hours instead of days. The concurrent request output automatically opens upon completion without the need for re-formatting.

You can [download](https://www.enginatics.com/download/) and use Blitz Report [free](https://www.enginatics.com/pricing/) of charge for your first 30 reports.
