# [ECC Concurrent Programs](https://www.enginatics.com/reports/ecc-concurrent-programs/)
## Description: 
Oracle note 2495053.1 lists all concurrent program names for Enterprise Command Centers:
https://support.oracle.com/CSP/main/article?cmd=show&type=NOT&id=2495053.1

This report can be used to check which of those required ECC load requests are currently scheduled.
The short code can then be used as multiple parameter value entry in other reports, e.g. https://www.enginatics.com/reports/fnd-access-control/ to see which responsibilities or users have access to schedule them, or https://www.enginatics.com/reports/fnd-concurrent-requests/ to look at past execution and schedule times.
