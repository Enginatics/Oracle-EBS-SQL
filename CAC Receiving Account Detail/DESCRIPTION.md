# Case Study & Technical Analysis: CAC Receiving Account Detail

## Executive Summary
The **CAC Receiving Account Detail** report is a forensic accounting tool for the Receiving module. It lists the specific accounting entries (Debits and Credits) generated by receiving transactions. This is critical for reconciling the "Receiving Inspection" (Asset) and "PO Accrual" (Liability) accounts.

## Business Challenge
*   **Reconciliation**: The General Ledger shows a balance in "Receiving Inspection" that doesn't match the subledger. Which transaction caused the drift?
*   **Accrual Auditing**: Verifying that the liability was booked correctly for a specific high-value receipt.
*   **SLA Visibility**: In R12, Subledger Accounting (SLA) rules can transform accounts. Users need to see the *final* account used, not just the default from the PO.

## Solution
This report bridges the gap between Operations and Finance.
*   **Granularity**: One row per accounting line (Debit or Credit).
*   **Context**: Links the journal line back to the PO Number, Receipt Number, Item, and Project.
*   **SLA Integration**: Can optionally pull data from `xla_ae_lines` to show the final transformation rules applied.

## Technical Architecture
*   **Tables**: `rcv_receiving_sub_ledger` (Pre-SLA), `xla_ae_lines` (Post-SLA), `rcv_transactions`.
*   **Logic**: The "Show SLA Accounting" parameter toggles between the raw subledger table and the XLA engine tables.

## Parameters
*   **Show SLA Accounting**: (Mandatory) "Yes" for accurate GL matching, "No" for faster operational checks.
*   **Transaction Date From/To**: (Mandatory) Accounting period.
*   **Minimum Absolute Amount**: (Optional) Filter out small rounding differences.

## Performance
*   **Variable**: Running with "Show SLA Accounting = Yes" is slower because it joins to the massive XLA tables.

## FAQ
**Q: Why are there two entries for one receipt?**
A: A standard receipt generates a Debit to Receiving Inspection and a Credit to the Accrual Account.
**Q: Does this show "Deliver" transactions?**
A: Yes, it shows the full flow: Receive (Dr Insp / Cr Accrual) -> Deliver (Dr Inv / Cr Insp).
