-- Report Name: DBA SGA Buffer Cache Object Usage
-- Description: SGA buffer cache space usage by object names (in MB).
'Object Percentage' shows how much of one particular object is currently stored in the buffer cache.
100% means that the object is completely in the buffer cache.

Current SGA memory usage is also listed in views:
select * from v$sga
select * from v$sgainfo
select * from v$sga_dynamic_components

Arup Nanda gives a good explanation on how the buffer cache works:
