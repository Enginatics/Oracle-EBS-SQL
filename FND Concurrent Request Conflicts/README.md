# [FND Concurrent Request Conflicts](https://www.enginatics.com/reports/fnd-concurrent-request-conflicts/)
## Description: 
Lists concurrent requests that were held by the conflict resolution manager and shows their conflicting / blocking requests which were running at the time between the requested start date and conflict release date.
This might not work 100% (it doesn't consider request set conflicts yet), but should give a good indication of most conflicting scenarios.

# Oracle E-Business Suite - Reporting Library 
    
We provide an open source EBS operational and project implementation support [library](https://www.enginatics.com/library/) for rapid Excel report generation. 

[Blitz Report™](https://www.enginatics.com/blitz-report/) is based on Oracle EBS forms technology, and hence requires minimal training. There are no data or performance limitations since the output files are created directly from the database without going through intermediate file formats such as XML. 

Standard Oracle [BI Publisher](https://www.enginatics.com/user-guide/#BI_Publisher) and [Discoverer](https://www.enginatics.com/blog/importing-discoverer-worksheets-into-blitz-report/) reports can also be imported into Blitz Report for immediate output to Excel. Typically, reports can be created and version tracked within hours instead of days. The concurrent request output automatically opens upon completion without the need for re-formatting.
