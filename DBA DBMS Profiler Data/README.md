We provide an open source Oracle EBS SQLs as a part of operational and project implementation support [toolkits](https://www.enginatics.com/blitz-report-toolkits/) for rapid Excel reports generation. 

[Blitz Report™](https://www.enginatics.com/blitz-report/) is based on Oracle EBS forms technology, and hence requires minimal training. There are no data or performance limitations since the output files are created directly from the database without going through intermediate file formats such as XML. 

Blitz Report can be used as BI Publisher and [Oracle Discoverer replacement tool](https://www.enginatics.com/blog/discoverer-replacement/). Standard Oracle [BI Publisher](https://www.enginatics.com/user-guide/#BI_Publisher) and [Discoverer](https://www.enginatics.com/blog/importing-discoverer-worksheets-into-blitz-report/) reports can also be imported into Blitz Report for immediate output to Excel. Typically, reports can be created and version tracked within hours instead of days. The concurrent request output automatically opens upon completion without the need for re-formatting.
