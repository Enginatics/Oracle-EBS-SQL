# Executive Summary
The **FND Log Messages** report provides access to the Oracle EBS debug log (FND Logging). It is the primary tool for diagnosing runtime errors and performance issues.

# Business Challenge
*   **Error Diagnosis:** Finding the specific error message and stack trace when a user reports a "System Error".
*   **Performance Tuning:** Analyzing the timing of log messages to identify slow-running code blocks.
*   **Security Audit:** Reviewing login failures or access denials logged by the system.

# The Solution
This Blitz Report queries `FND_LOG_MESSAGES`:
*   **Message Text:** The actual log entry.
*   **Module:** The code module (e.g., `fnd.plsql.Security`).
*   **User:** The user who triggered the message.
*   **Level:** The severity (Statement, Procedure, Event, Exception, Error, Unexpected).

# Technical Architecture
The report queries `FND_LOG_MESSAGES` and joins to `FND_USER` for context.

# Parameters & Filtering
*   **User Name:** Filter for logs generated by a specific user session.
*   **Module Contains:** Filter for specific code areas (e.g., `%OAF%`).
*   **Log Level:** Filter to see only Errors or Exceptions.

# Performance & Optimization
*   **High Volume:** The log table can be massive. Always filter by Date and User/Module.
*   **Retention:** Logs are typically purged daily or weekly, so run this report soon after the issue occurs.

# FAQ
*   **Q: Why is the report empty?**
    *   A: FND Logging must be enabled via profile options (`FND: Debug Log Enabled`, `FND: Debug Log Level`) for messages to be written to the database.
