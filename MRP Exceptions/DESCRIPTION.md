# MRP Exceptions - Case Study & Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary
The **MRP Exceptions** report is the primary "to-do list" for material planners. It filters the massive amount of data generated by an MRP run into actionable alerts. Instead of reviewing every item, planners focus only on items where the plan is "broken" or requires intervention, such as late orders, potential shortages, or excess inventory.

## Business Challenge
An MRP run might generate thousands of planned orders and recommendations. Planners cannot review them all. They need to know:
-   **Urgency:** "Which orders are already late and need immediate expediting?"
-   **Efficiency:** "Which orders can be cancelled because the demand went away?"
-   **Data Integrity:** "Which items have missing lead times or invalid planning parameters?"

## Solution
The **MRP Exceptions** report highlights these specific issues using standard exception messages.

**Key Features:**
-   **Action-Oriented:** Groups items by exception type (e.g., "Orders to be cancelled," "Orders with compression days").
-   **Prioritization:** Allows filtering by Planner Code, so each planner sees only their own items.
-   **Details:** Provides the specific context (e.g., "Order 123 is late by 5 days").

## Technical Architecture
The report queries the exception messages generated during the planning process.

### Key Tables and Views
-   **`MRP_EXCEPTION_DETAILS_V`**: The primary view containing the exception messages linked to specific items and plans.
-   **`MTL_SYSTEM_ITEMS_VL`**: Provides item descriptions and planning attributes.
-   **`MTL_PLANNERS`**: Used to filter exceptions by the responsible planner.

### Core Logic
1.  **Exception Generation:** During the MRP run, the engine identifies conditions that violate planning rules (e.g., supply date > need date).
2.  **Categorization:** These conditions are flagged with specific Exception Types (e.g., Type 10 = "Orders to be cancelled").
3.  **Reporting:** The report retrieves these records, joined with item and planner details for context.

## Business Impact
-   **Productivity:** Drastically reduces the time planners spend analyzing data, allowing them to focus on fixing problems.
-   **Responsiveness:** Ensures that critical shortages (potential stockouts) are identified and addressed immediately.
-   **Cost Reduction:** Helps identify excess inventory (orders to cancel) and avoid unnecessary expediting costs.
