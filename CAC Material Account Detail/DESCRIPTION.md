# Case Study & Technical Analysis: CAC Material Account Detail

## Executive Summary
The **CAC Material Account Detail** report is the ultimate reconciliation tool for Inventory Accounting. It provides a granular, line-by-line view of the accounting distributions generated by material transactions. Whether you are investigating a specific variance, auditing a high-value adjustment, or reconciling the General Ledger, this report provides the "Subledger" truth.

## Business Challenge
*   **Reconciliation**: When the GL balance doesn't match the Inventory Valuation report, accountants need to find the specific transactions causing the difference.
*   **SLA Complexity**: With Subledger Accounting (SLA), the final GL account might differ from the default account on the transaction. Tracing this transformation is difficult.
*   **Project Accounting**: For project-based organizations, verifying that costs hit the correct Project and Task is critical for billing.

## Solution
This report exposes the full accounting lifecycle.
*   **Dual Mode**: Can report either the "Raw" accounting (from `mtl_transaction_accounts`) or the "Final" SLA accounting (from `xla_distribution_links`), depending on the parameter.
*   **Context**: Includes WIP Job, Project, and Inter-org transfer details to explain *why* the entry occurred.
*   **Filtering**: Powerful filters for Transaction Type, Source, and Amount allow users to isolate specific issues (e.g., "Show me all Account Alias Issues over $10,000").

## Technical Architecture
*   **Core Tables**: `mtl_material_transactions` (MMT) and `mtl_transaction_accounts` (MTA).
*   **SLA Integration**: If "Show SLA" is Yes, it joins to `xla_distribution_links`, `xla_ae_headers`, and `xla_ae_lines`.
*   **Performance**: Uses the `pii` (Profit in Inventory) logic structure but adapted for standard reporting.

## Parameters
*   **Transaction Date From/To**: (Mandatory) Reporting period.
*   **Show SLA Accounting**: (Mandatory) Toggle for SLA vs. Legacy accounting.
*   **Show Projects/WIP**: (Mandatory) Toggles to control report width and detail.
*   **Minimum Absolute Amount**: (Optional) To filter out penny variances.

## Performance
*   **Heavy**: This report queries the largest tables in the system. Running it for a full year or "All Items" is not recommended.
*   **Optimization**: Always filter by Date Range and Organization.

## FAQ
**Q: Why do I see two sets of entries?**
A: If you have "Show SLA" enabled, you might be seeing the secondary ledger entries or multiple accounting representations.

**Q: What is "Transfer Transaction ID"?**
A: For inter-org transfers, this links the Shipment transaction to the Receipt transaction, allowing you to see both sides of the entry.

**Q: Does it show encumbrances?**
A: No, this report focuses on Actuals (Cost Accounting). Encumbrances are handled in Purchasing/GL.
