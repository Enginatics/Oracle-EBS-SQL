# MRP Plan Orders - Case Study & Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary
The **MRP Plan Orders** report is a comprehensive export of the "Supply/Demand" window in the Planner's Workbench. It lists every single transaction (supply or demand) considered by the plan, providing a complete picture of the material situation for selected items.

## Business Challenge
Planners often need to analyze planning data outside of the Oracle forms.
-   **Mass Analysis:** "I want to see all planned orders for my 500 items in Excel so I can filter by date and supplier."
-   **Supplier Collaboration:** "I need to send a list of all upcoming requirements to my key supplier."
-   **Audit:** "I need to verify that the plan included the On-Hand inventory correctly."

## Solution
The **MRP Plan Orders** report dumps the detailed supply/demand list.

**Key Features:**
-   **Comprehensive Scope:** Includes On-Hand, Purchase Orders, Work Orders, Planned Orders, Sales Orders, and Forecasts.
-   **Actionable Data:** Shows "Action Messages" (e.g., "Release", "Reschedule In", "Cancel").
-   **Date Visibility:** Displays both the "Suggested Date" (when MRP wants it) and the "Old Date" (when it is currently scheduled).

## Technical Architecture
The report replicates the query behind the Planner's Workbench Supply/Demand view.

### Key Tables and Views
-   **`MRP_ORDERS_SC_V`**: A complex view that unions all supply and demand sources (WIP, PO, OE, MRP) into a single structure.
-   **`MRP_RECOMMENDATIONS`**: Stores the new planned orders generated by the engine.
-   **`MRP_GROSS_REQUIREMENTS`**: Stores the demand side.

### Core Logic
1.  **Aggregation:** The view combines data from disparate modules (Inventory, Purchasing, WIP, Order Management) and the MRP plan tables.
2.  **Filtering:** Applies filters for Plan Name, Organization, and Item.
3.  **Sorting:** Typically sorts by Due Date to show the chronological flow of inventory.

## Business Impact
-   **Operational Efficiency:** Allows planners to work in Excel, where they can easily sort, filter, and pivot the data.
-   **Supplier Management:** Provides a clean, formatted list of future requirements to share with vendors.
-   **Data Validation:** Serves as a primary tool for debugging why the plan generated specific results.
